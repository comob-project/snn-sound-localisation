   abstract = {Our concepts of sound localization in the vertebrate brain are widely based on the general assumption that both the ability to detect air-borne sounds and the neuronal processing are homologous in archosaurs (present day crocodiles and birds) and mammals. Yet studies repeatedly report conflicting results on the neuronal circuits and mechanisms, in particular the role of inhibition, as well as the coding strategies between avian and mammalian model systems. Here we argue that mammalian and avian phylogeny of spatial hearing is characterized by a convergent evolution of hearing air-borne sounds rather than by homology. In particular, the different evolutionary origins of tympanic ears and the different availability of binaural cues in early mammals and archosaurs imposed distinct constraints on the respective binaural processing mechanisms. The role of synaptic inhibition in generating binaural spatial sensitivity in mammals is highlighted, as it reveals a unifying principle of mammalian circuit design for encoding sound position. Together, we combine evolutionary, anatomical and physiological arguments for making a clear distinction between mammalian processing mechanisms and coding strategies and those of archosaurs. We emphasize that a consideration of the convergent nature of neuronal mechanisms will significantly increase the explanatory power of studies of spatial processing in both mammals and birds.},

Synaptic inhibition has been implicated in tuning ITD sensitivity, but the cellular mechanisms underlying its influence on coincidence detection are debated. Here we determine the impact of inhibition on coincidence detection in adult Mongolian gerbil MSO brain slices by testing precise temporal integration of measured synaptic responses using conductance-clamp. We find that inhibition dynamically shifts the peak timing of excitation, depending on its relative arrival time, which in turn modulates the timing of best coincidence detection. Inhibitory control of coincidence detection timing is consistent with the diversity of ITD functions observed in vivo and is robust under physiologically relevant conditions. Our results provide strong evidence that temporal interactions between excitation and inhibition on microsecond timescales are critical for binaural processing. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Each MSO neuron has its own "best ITD" to which it responds optimally. A difference in physical path length of the excitatory inputs from both ears cannot fully account for the ITD tuning of MSO neurons. As a result, it is still debated how these inputs interact and whether the segregation of inputs to opposite dendrites, well-timed synaptic inhibition, or asymmetries in synaptic potentials or cellular morphology further optimize coincidence detection or ITD tuning. Using invivo whole-cell and juxtacellular recordings, we show here that ITD tuning of MSO neurons is determined by the timing of their excitatory inputs. The inputs from both ears sum linearly, whereas spike probability depends nonlinearly on the size of synaptic inputs. This simple coincidence detection scheme thus makes accurate sound localization possible},

   abstract = {The dominant cue for localization of low-frequency sounds are microsecond differences in the time-of-arrival of sounds at the two ears [interaural time difference (ITD)]. In mammals, ITD sensitivity is established in the medial superior olive (MSO) by coincidence detection of excitatory inputs from both ears. Hence the relative delay of the binaural inputs is crucial for adjusting ITD sensitivity in MSO cells. Howthese delays are constructed is, however, still unknown. Specifically, the question of whether inhibitory inputs are involved in timing the net excitation in MSO cells, and if so how, is controversial. These inhibitory inputs derive from the nuclei of the trapezoid body, which have physiological and structural specializations for high-fidelity temporal transmission, raising the possibility that well timed inhibition is involved in tuning ITD sensitivity. Here, we present physiological and pharmacological data from in vivo extracellular MSO recordings in anesthetized gerbils. Reversible blockade of synaptic inhibition by iontophoretic application of the glycine antagonist strychnine increased firing rates and significantly shifted ITD sensitivity of MSO neurons. This indicates that glycinergic inhibition plays a major role in tuning the delays of binaural excitation. We also tonically applied glycine, which lowered firing rates but also shifted ITD sensitivity in a way analogous to strychnine. Hence tonic glycine application experimentally decoupled the effect of inhibition from the timing of its inputs. We conclude that, for proper ITD processing, not only is inhibition necessary, but it must also be precisely timed. Copyright © 2008 Society for Neuroscience.},

  abstract = {Microsecond differences in the arrival time of a sound at the two ears (interaural time differences, ITDs) are the main cue for localizing low-frequency sounds in space. Traditionally, ITDs are thought to be encoded by an array of coincidence-detector neurons, receiving excitatory inputs from the two ears via axons of variable length (‘delay lines’), to create a topographic map of azimuthal auditory space. Compelling evidence for the existence of such a map in the mammalian ITD detector, the medial superior olive (MSO), however, is lacking. Equally puzzling is the role of a—temporally very precise—glycine-mediated inhibitory input to MSO neurons. Using in vivo recordings from the MSO of the Mongolian gerbil, we found the responses of ITD-sensitive neurons to be inconsistent with the idea of a topographic map of auditory space. Moreover, local application of glycine and its antagonist strychnine by iontophoresis (through glass pipette electrodes, by means of an electric current) revealed that precisely timed glycine-controlled inhibition is a critical part of the mechanism by which the physiologically relevant range of ITDs is encoded in the MSO. A computer model, simulating the response of a coincidence-detector neuron with bilateral excitatory inputs and a temporally precise contralateral inhibitory input, supports this conclusion.},

   abstract = {Feedforward inhibition sharpens the precision of neurons throughout ascending auditory pathways, including the binaural neurons of the medial superior olive (MSO). However, the biophysical influence of inhibition is poorly understood, particularly at higher frequencies at which the relative phase of inhibition and excitation becomes ambiguous. Here, we show in gerbil MSO principal cells invitro that feedforward inhibition precedes direct excitation, providing a concurrent hyperpolarization and conductance shunt during EPSP summation. We show with dual-patch recordings and dynamic clamp that both the linearity and temporal fidelity of synaptic integration is improved by reducing Kv1 potassium channel conductance during inhibition, which counters membrane shunting even at high frequencies at which IPSPs sum. The reduction of peak excitation by preceding inhibition lowers spike probability, narrowing but not shifting the window for detecting binaural coincidence. The interplay between inhibition and potassium conductances thus improves the consistency and resolution of ITD coding across different frequencies},

   abstract = {A ubiquitous feature of the auditory organ in amniotes is the longitudinal mapping of neuronal characteristic frequencies (CFs), which increase exponentially with distance along the organ. The exponential tonotopic map reflects variation in hair cell properties according to cochlear location and is thought to stem from concentration gradients in diffusible morphogenic proteins during embryonic development. While in all amniotes the spatial gradient is initiated by sonic hedgehog (SHH), released from the notochord and floorplate, subsequent molecular pathways are not fully understood. In chickens, BMP7 is one such morphogen, secreted from the distal end of the cochlea. In mammals, the developmental mechanism differs from birds and may depend on cochlear location. A consequence of exponential maps is that each octave occupies an equal distance on the cochlea, a spacing preserved in the tonotopic maps in higher auditory brain regions. This may facilitate frequency analysis and recognition of acoustic sequences.},

We review the progress over the past third of a century, with a focus on the mammalian brainstem and on the anatomy and cellular physiology underlying the physiological tuning of monaural and binaural circuits to acoustic cues toward spatial hearing.

The basic idea of this model is that the auditory system attempts to eliminate the masking components by first transforming the stimuli presented to the two ears so as to equalize the two masking components, and then subtracting. In order to obtain results that are quantitatively realistic, this processing is assumed to be corrupted by various types of errors. The model is applied to data in which the signal to be detected consists of a pulsed tone, the masking signal consists of loud, broad‐band, Gaussian noise, and the only differences between the stimuli presented to the two ears are those of time delay or amplitude (the interaural amplitude ratios being restricted to unity or zero). The results indicate that the ability of the auditory. system to control interaural intensity ratios and interaural time delays is limited to accuracies of about 1 dB and 150 μsec and that the auditory system has difficulty in compensating for interaural time delays greater than the time it takes for sound to travel a distance equal to the width of the head.},

	abstract = {Binaural masking level differences (BMLDs) are improvements in the masked detection thresholds of sounds that require binaural listening and are not attributable to improvements in signal-to-noise ratio. A BMLD can occur when there are differences in interaural phase, delay or level between target and masker. Equalization cancellation (EC) theory has long been a popular framework for explaining BMLDs. Durlach (1963, 1972) developed EC theory mathematically, predicting the results of each experiment using specific equations. His EC theory is admirably simple in concept and has only two fitted parameters, yet it generates many accurate predictions and invariably captures the general pattern of the data. However, some predictions remain grossly inaccurate or ambiguous. Two adapted EC models will be presented. One is a hybrid model that derives internal representations of the speech and noise computationally and then uses a single equation to predict the BMLD. The other is completely computational. The models include broadened auditory filtering, a cost function for the use of large internal delays, and, in the case for the computational model, peripheral non-linearities. The models will be used to demonstrate that a cost function and peripheral non-linearities are essential to provide accurate predictions of classic results in the literature. Broadened auditory filters have some explanatory power, but their role is indistinguishable with broadened from that of delay cost.},

Despite the ubiquity of such spiking, we currently lack an understanding of how biological spiking neural circuits learn and compute in-vivo, as well as how we can instantiate such capabilities in artificial spiking circuits in-silico. Here we revisit the problem of supervised learning in temporally coding multi-layer spiking neural networks. First, by using a surrogate gradient approach, we derive SuperSpike, a nonlinear voltage-based three factor learning rule capable of training multi-layer networks of deterministic integrate-and-fire neurons to perform nonlinear computations on spatiotemporal spike patterns. Second, inspired by recent results on feedback alignment, we compare the performance of our learning rule under different credit assignment strategies for propagating output errors to hidden units. Specifically, we test uniform, symmetric and random feedback, finding that simpler tasks can be solved with any type of feedback, while more complex tasks require symmetric feedback. In summary, our results open the door to obtaining a better scientific understanding of learning and computation in spiking neural networks by advancing our ability to train them to solve nonlinear problems involving transformations between different spatiotemporal spike-time patterns.},

	abstract = {The activity of sensory neural populations carries information about the environment. This may be extracted from neural activity using different strategies. In the auditory brainstem, a recent theory proposes that sound location in the horizontal plane is decoded from the relative summed activity of two populations in each hemisphere, whereas earlier theories hypothesized that the location was decoded from the identity of the most active cells. We tested the performance of various decoders of neural responses in increasingly complex acoustical situations, including spectrum variations, noise, and sound diffraction. We demonstrate that there is insufficient information in the pooled activity of each hemisphere to estimate sound direction in a reliable way consistent with behavior, whereas robust estimates can be obtained from neural activity by taking into account the heterogeneous tuning of cells. These estimates can still be obtained when only contralateral neural responses are used, consistently with unilateral lesion studies. © Goodman et al.},

	abstract = {A cortical neuron typically makes multiple synaptic contacts on the dendrites of its postsynaptic target neuron. The functional implications of this apparent redundancy are unclear. Due to dendritic cable filtering, proximal dendritic synapses generate brief somatic postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) whereas distal synapses give rise to broader PSPs. Consequently, with multiple synaptic contacts, a single presynaptic spike results in a somatic PSP composed of multiple temporal profiles. We developed a “Filter-and-Fire” (F\&F) neuron model that incorporates multiple contacts and cable filtering; it demonstrates threefold increase in memory capacity as compared to a leaky Integrate-and-Fire (I\&F) neuron, when trained to emit precisely timed spikes for specific input patterns. Furthermore, the F\&F neuron can learn to recognize spatio-temporal input patterns, e.g., MNIST digits, where the I\&F model completely fails. We conclude that “dendro-plexing” single input spikes by multiple synaptic contacts enriches the computational capabilities of cortical neurons and can dramatically reduce axonal wiring.},

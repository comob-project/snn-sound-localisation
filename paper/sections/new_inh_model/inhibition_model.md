### Highlights
Here we use a more biologically inspired model to overcome some limitations that have been highlighted in the classic Jeffress model, whose existence, in mammals, is still debated. We focused on the inhibitory inputs to the MSO, which were found both anatomically (there are inhibitory ipsilateral and contralateral pathways) and computationally (in our model) to have a central role for coding ITDs. Experiments with inhibition blocked (by a glycine antagonist: strychnine) show indeed a loss of ITD-coding in the MSO.

### Introduction 

Our starting point was that it is not possible to fully understand ITD sensitivity in the medial superior olive (MSO) without an understanding of ILD representation in the lateral superior olive (LSO). From an evolutionary point of view, specific to the mammalian phylogenetic tree, the MSO can in fact be considered a refined version of the older LSO [@Grothe2014].

LSO principal cells have a bipolar dendritic tree that receives excitatory input from the ipsilateral ear and inhibitory input from the contralateral one. All mammals appear to apply one common neural strategy for processing ILDs, which consists of subtraction between these two inputs. For instance, neurons in the right LSO will be more excited when sound arrives from the right and more inhibited when sound arrives from the left. The function that describes LSO neurons’ firing rate according to different azimuth angles is usually a sigmoid, presenting the highest values for sound coming from the hemispace ipsilateral to the nucleus, with a steep slope centered on frontal angles (i.e., close to 0°), possibly suggesting a rate-coding strategy for identifying different ILD values with high sensitivity for frontal angles, as suggested by psychoacoustic evidence.

Despite the on-off nature of this subtraction strategy, for which exquisite timing of inhibitory influences appears not to be a key prerequisite, the two major inputs to the LSO are specialized for high-fidelity temporal transmission. An explanation is found in the fact that the subtraction process happening in LSO principal cells is realized in a phase-locked way with respect to the stimulus. This suggests a purely suppressive coincidence mechanism happening at each period of the phase-locked inputs to the LSO (spiking occurs unless there is a binaural coincidence).

The MSO, on the other hand, receives two additional inputs compared to the LSO: a contralateral excitation and an ipsilateral inhibition. As a result of experimental observations, it has been hypothesised that the combination of these four inputs has converted the suppressive coincidence mechanism present in the LSO into an excitatory coincidence mechanism for the detection of ITDs in the MSO (spiking occurs only if binaural coincidence is happening) [@Grothe2014].

We evaluated the activity of these four nuclei (left and right LSO and MSO), using the firing rates of model LSOs as a validation platform for our network, while exploring the impact of certain parameters in the processing of ITDs in the _in silico_ MSO.
In order to define a firing rate activity target during this second phase of the work, we used the results from the following two experimental studies:

- {cite:t}`Brand2002` analysed _in vivo_ recordings from the MSO of the _Mongolian gerbil_ and showed how all the 20 neurons tested responded maximally to sounds leading in time at the contralateral ear. Peaks in the firing rate of these neurons were also found for (artificial) ITD values higher than the highest possible ones generated by the gerbil head, which correspond to almost 120 μs for a sound coming at 90° from the contralateral hemispace. 

- {cite:t}`Pecka2008` explored how the physical mechanisms underlie the shift in peak activity towards contralateral ITD values. The results showed how the two inhibitory inputs to the MSO, which are not considered in the Jeffress model, play a central role in this process. By blocking the glycinergic inhibition to the MSO neurons by its antagonist, strychnine, the authors observed the loss of the peak shift in all their response activity. With inhibition blocked, all the neuron responses peaked at null ITD values (i.e., 0° azimuth angle). Inhibition was thus shown to have a central role in identifying the ITD values in the MSO. Consequently, in our model we tried to block these inhibitory inputs to explore the effect that they have on the MSO activity.

Finally, we wanted to understand how the firing rate activity of different neurons in the MSO could be differentiated (i.e. different peak positions in the contralateral space) in order to code for different ITD values and consequently different sound source azimuth angles.

Some additional experimental studies reported how inhibitory inputs, especially the contralateral one, can arrive slightly in advance of the excitatory inputs from the corresponding sides, thus influencing the way ipsilateral and contralateral inputs add up in the MSO neurons and thereby generating a range of maximum responses for contralateral ITD values [@Myoga2014;@Roberts2013]. Nevertheless, other work has characterized the hypothesis of anticipation of inhibitory inputs as implausible [@vanderHeijden2013]. 

In the absence of a clear and shared hypothesis in the literature, we decided to explore further, asking whether or not MSO responses could depend on different shapes of post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), both excitatory (EPSPs) and inhibitory (IPSPs).

### Methods
We implemented a complex spiking neural network in Python using the NEST Simulator framework [@spreizer_2022_6368024]. The different neuronal populations composing the brainstem circuit and their interconnections are shown in {ref}`network_diagram`.

End-to-end brainstem model. Incoming sounds are converted into spectrograms, and fed to each ear with a delay $t_{L/R}$ and gain $L_{L/R}$ (modelled as maximum firing rate or count). Auditory nerve fibre (ANF) responses are modelled as phase locked Gaussian pulse packets. ANF spikes are fed into a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons with the architecture shown, before ultimately being converted into firing rates at the LSO/MSO outputs.  The number of neurons for each population is written in the respective block.
```

The principal inputs to the network are the spectrogram of a sound stimulus arriving at both ears and the azimuth angle from which values of ITD and ILD are computed.

For simplicity, the ITD value is modelled by two ears separated by a fixed width with no head (so the time difference is $w_\mathrm{head}\sin(\mathrm{Azimuth})/c$ for $c$ the speed of sound in air). The ILD value is modelled as a difference in the number of spikes between the left and right auditory nerve fibers (ANFs). This strategy does not take into account the frequency- and distance-specific variability of the ITD and ILD values, however for this study it was sufficient as we only used a single fixed frequency and distance.

The spectrogram covers 20 Hz to 20 kHz (the whole human audible range) in 3500 channels, the estimated number of inner hair cells (IHCs) present in the human cochlea. The width of each frequency channel was not constant throughout the range but grew exponentially as in {cite:t}`Fettiplace2023`. Spectra were modelled directly as a Gaussian covering 21 channels around the tone frequency, with a constant value over time.

The ANFs were modelled as spike trains with Gaussian phase-locked [@Yin2019] spike packets using the `pulse_packet_generator` built-in NEST "device". 
This allowed us to define the number of spikes in each packet (varying accordingly to the ILD), with spike times that are normally distributed with respect to the central time of the pulse. A source of noise was introduced by setting the standard deviation of the random displacement from the center of the pulse equal to 0.1 ms.

All other cell populations except the MSO (described below) were implemented through `iaf_cond_alpha` models (a simple implementation of a spiking neuron in NEST using integrate-and-fire dynamics with conductance-based synapses and a postsynaptic change of conductance modelled by an alpha function). With this model we implemented the bushy cells (spherical and globular, SBCs and GBCs) located in the anteroventral part of the cochlear nuclei, the glycinergic neurons located in the medial and lateral trapezoidal body (MNTB and LNTB), and finally the main cells of the lateral superior olives (LSOs). All the default parameters of this NEST model were kept unchanged (see {ref}`iaf_data`.) apart from the membrane capacitance ‘C_m’, which was lowered to 1 pF to ensure sufficiently quick membrane time constants as seen experimentally in these neurons {cite:t}`Cao2007`.

The MSO principal cells were instead implemented through the `iaf_cond_beta` model. The use of a beta function to replicate the postsynaptic change of conductance allowed us to specify independently the time constants of the rise and fall of the conductance change and thus modify both the excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potential shapes in the MSO. In this way, we could explore different sets of values and attempt to validate our hypothesis about how inhibitory inputs can code for different ITD values in MSO cells, see [](#inhib-intro).

For the validation of the complete brainstem network, including both LSO and MSO of both sides, sound stimuli with frequencies of 100 Hz and 1 s duration from different spatial positions were tested (azimuth angles ranging from -90° to +90° with an interval of 15°). 
The MSO response was tested both in physiological conditions and with blocked inhibitory inputs, as in the experiments of {cite:t}`Brand2002` and {cite:t}`Pecka2008`.

### Results 
Model LSO responses are shown in {ref}`lso_mso`, matching the desired subtraction process described in [](#inhib-intro). Considering for the sake of simplicity the left LSO, when the sound arrives from a source placed at 90° (i.e., right), the right ear receives sounds earlier and more intensely than the left. As the azimuth angle proceeds toward 0° (frontal position), the firing rate of the left LSO increases while maintaining a constant slope. Once past 0°, the firing rate ceases to increase steadily, and the response flattens out to high-rate values. Here, the ipsilateral (left) excitation dominates due to louder sounds.

Mean firing-rate responses of the left LSO (on the left) and the left MSO (on the right) after stimulation with a 100 Hz pure tone sound for 1 second at different azimuth angles. For the MSO, four neurons with different time constants are shown. Neuron 1 responds maximally for input at +15°, Neuron 2 at +30°, Neuron 3 at +45°, and Neuron 4 at +90°.
```

Model MSO responses are also shown in {ref}`lso_mso`, where the different curves represent the activity of four neurons in the left MSO for which we varied only the value of the time constants of the decay in conductance generated by input spikes for both excitatory (`tau_decay_exc`) and inhibitory (`tau_decay_inh`) inputs. We observed that different combinations of these two values provided coding for a specific angle achieved by a peak at different angles (and thus different ITD values) in that cell's activity. As observed experimentally, all peaks were present in the contralateral sound space, thus confirming the hypothesis that, in contrast to the coding strategy applied in the LSO, higher activity is present in the MSO for sounds from the contralateral space.

We simulated MSO cells receiving only excitatory inputs ({ref}`blocked_inh`). A loss in the coding of different contralateral angles is evident from a symmetric firing rate curve, with all the peak values being higher and shifted towards 0° angles with respect to the physiological activity, as measured experimentally in {cite:t}`Pecka2008`.

```{figure} sections/new_inh_model/blocked_inh.png

:width: 100%

Loss of contralateral ITD peak-coding for the four different neurons in the left MSO: the control condition (with physiological inhibitory inputs) is shown in blue, whereas the curves in red depict the condition with blocked inhibition to the MSO. In the latter scenario, firing-rate values are higher with respect to the former and peaks are shifted to null ITD values, so that the coding of each neuron for a specific azimuth angle is now lost.
```

### Discussion

The computational model developed validates recent theories concerning the processing of the ITDs in the MSO. The peak-coding strategy applied for the identification of contralateral angles in each MSO can be considered a refinement of the rate-based localization of sounds happening in the LSO. As described in the [](#inhib-intro), this type of redundancy is also justified by the evolutionary history of spatial hearing mechanisms in mammals.
The differentiation in the activity of MSO neurons due to the different time constants of the decay in conductance generated by input spikes was found to be a valid hypothesis for implementing the coding of ITDs. In the end, this work leads to the possible conclusion that strategies similar to those used for the processing of ILDs could also been readapted for the processing of ITDs and that, in the brainstem of modern mammals, these two processes could occur in parallel, merging at a higher level, and thus providing a more refined and complete spatial map.

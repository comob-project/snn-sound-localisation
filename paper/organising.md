# Organising the paper

We are currently in the process of writing up the paper. If you are one of the contributors and you would like to be recognised as an author on this paper, please make yourself known to us. Either email [Dan Goodman](mailto:d.goodman@imperial.ac.uk) or join the [SNUFA discord channel](https://discord.gg/aYvgGakrVK) ``#sound-localisation-paper`` (or both).

The current plan for writing up the paper is as follows:

1. Gather information on all contributors (names, email addresses, institutions, etc.). Current plan is that Marcus will be first author, I will be last author, and no decision about author ordering other than that. Please give your thoughts, including whether or not you disagree with the first/last author places (this is fine if you disagree, it's just a temporary decision). If nobody has strong feelings we may just randomise the rest of the order.
2. Clean up and merge all notebooks into main. Please note that I have renamed some of the notebooks, moved some into the research folder, and changes the headings on some to give them better descriptions. You may have conflicts that need resolving in your pull request.
3. Marcus and I will write a first draft of the main body of the paper that will attempt to summarise everything as well as talk about the process. You can see the results so far online as we write.
4. If you want to do a write up of your section in more detail including methods, results, etc. these will be included in the Appendices part of the paper.
5. Every notebook will be included in the Supplementary Materials section of the paper.
6. I am happy to discuss any of the decisions above. I've only made them in order to get things going quickly!
7. We'll do several rounds of iteration and comments. We will also continue our monthly meetings and discuss at those.
8. We'll submit a preprint of the paper to arXiv or bioRxiv.
9. We'll try to get this submitted to a journal.

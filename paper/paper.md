+++ {"part": "abstract"}
* We started a project to run a massively collaborative online modelling project.
* We built a successful infrastructure to manage this.
* We provided great training opportunities.
* The project functioned as a successful incubator of ideas.
* We made some progress in modelling sound localisation with spiking neural networks.
* Future iterations would benefit from clearer paths to participation and more structure / more clearly defined goals.

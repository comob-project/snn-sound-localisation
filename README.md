# SNN Sound Localization

Training spiking neural networks for sound localization

## Workflow

A detailed description can be found in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. Briefly, the `notebooks/` directory is a
free-for-all, just try to keep your work in your own notebook to avoid conflicts. When you have a polished piece of work
(e.g. to generate a figure for the paper), open a pull request to add it to the `spikeloc/` directory where the "finished"
code lives. Code must be reviewed before being merged into `spikeloc/`.

If you need help with using git/Github, just ask in the discord and someone will lend a hand!

## Installation

We recommend installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), and then run the following.

1. `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. `conda activate spikeloc`
3. `jupter notebook`

## Inspiration

We were inspired by the [Polymath Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project) which managed to successfully
solve previously unsolved mathematical problems in a similar open fashion. Science ought to be a collaborative enterprise,
not a competition. This project is an experiment to see if this approach can be successful in the field of computational
neuroscience, which, like mathematics, only requires a computer and access to the internet to contribute to.

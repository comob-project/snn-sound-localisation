* Inspired by the success of endeavours like the Human Genome Project (ref) and CERN (ref), neuroscientists are increasingly initiating large-scale collaborations. 
* Though, how to best structure these projects remains an open-question (ref Zach).  
* The largest efforts, e.g. The Blue Brain Project (ref), Human Brain Project (ref) and International Brain Laboratory (ref) bring together tens to hundreds of researchers across multiple laboratories.  
* However, while these projects represent a step-change in scale, they retain a legacy structure which resembles a consortia grant. 
* I.e. there are participating laboratories who make their data, methods and results available upon publication.
* As such, interested participants face a high barrier to entry: joining a participating laboratory, initiating a collaboration or awaiting publications. 

* An alternative are bench marking contests, in which participants compete to obtain the best score on a specific task. 
* For example, in Brain-Score (refs) participants must... (develop a model, which then gets tested).       
* These contests offer a significantly lower barrier to entry.
* However, emphasise competition over collaboration, and require a well defined, quantifiable end-point.  

* Here, inspired by a project in pure mathematics (ref) we present an alternative structure for such projects, and share our experiences and preliminary results.

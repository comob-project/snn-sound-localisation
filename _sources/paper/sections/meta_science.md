# Infrastructure
## GitHub
* At the heart of our project was our GitHub repository (link) which included 
* 

## Onboarding
* Our project grew out of a tutorial at the Cosyne conference (2022) for which we provided video lectures and code online (ref). 
* Participants joining the project were encouraged to review this material, and then to work through an introductory jupyter notebook containing Python code, figures and markdown text, which taught them how to train a spiking neural network to perform a sound localisation task.  
* Participants were then directed to our website where we maintained a list of open scientific and technical questions.
* For example, how does the use of different neuron models impact networks and can we train the input delays with gradient descent?     

## Communication 
* Synchronous online workshops 
* Aynchronous online communication

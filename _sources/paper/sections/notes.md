# Notes 

## IBL: An International Laboratory for Systems and Computational Neuroscience 
* https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2017.12.013 
* Aim: *to develop a standardized mouse decision-making behaviour, to make coordinated measurements of neural activity across the mouse brain, and to use theory and analyses to uncover the neural computations that support decision-making.* 
* *Understanding the Brain Demands a Collaborative Approach*. 
* *Overall, there is a disparity in scale between the brainâ€™s complexity and the efforts of individual neuroscience laboratories.*
* Allow postdocs to lead hypothesis-driven projects (e.g. on the role of a single brain region), while benefitting from shared resources. 
* Will make data *accessible once the results are published* - why wait?
